== Full ==
- [X] Get domain/boundary id from gmsh grid file
- [X] Run a sample acousto-elastic problem
- [X] Set point load from main.cc instead of the assembly function

== Step 1 ==
- [ ] Add fluid assembly with approx. second-order form
- [ ] Add mulit-point Arnoldi reduction function (write to disk)
- [ ] Read Arnoldi vectors and orthogonalise them (read from disk)
- [ ] Project and solve

== Step 2 ==
- [ ] Compute wave number ratio and validate
